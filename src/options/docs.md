# LLM Novel Translator (BYOK)

Welcome to the **LLM Novel Translator** extension! This tool is designed to help you read web novels in your preferred language using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Introduction

This extension operates on a **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** model. It does not have a central server that processes your translations. Instead, it connects directly from your browser to the LLM providers (like OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter, etc.) using the API keys you provide. This ensures your privacy and gives you full control over the models and costs.

## API Keys

To use this extension, you **must** provide at least one API key.

1.  Go to the **API Keys** tab in the sidebar.
2.  Enter your API key for your preferred provider(s).
3.  Click **Save**.

### Recommended Provider
If you don't have an API key or are unsure which one to use, we recommend **[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)**. They offer a wide range of models from various providers (including free and low-cost options) with a single API key.

## Quick Start Guide

1.  **Set API Key**: Enter and save your API key in the **API Keys** tab.
2.  **Language Config**: (Optional) Go to **Model / Translation Config** and set your default **Source** and **Target** languages.
3.  **Verify Settings**: Scroll down in the **Model / Translation Config** tab to ensure the models for "Glossary Generation", "Text Segmentation", and "Translation" are selected and is what you intend to be used.
4.  **Save**: Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.
5.  **Ready!** The extension is now ready to use.

## Usage

### Supported Websites
For websites with built-in support (where the extension knows how to extract the novel text):
1.  Navigate to the novel chapter page.
2.  Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar.
3.  Click **Translate** in the popup window.

### Other Websites
For any other website:
1.  **Highlight** the text you want to translate.
2.  Click the extension icon.
3.  Click **Translate**.

## Model / Translation Config

In the **Model / Translation Config** tab, you can customize which LLM models are used for different stages of the translation pipeline. You can mix and match providers (e.g., use a cheaper model for glossary updates and a high-quality model for the final translation).

### Estimated Costs

The cost of translating a chapter depends heavily on the models you choose and the length of the text. The extension defaults to cost-efficient models (like DeepSeek V3.2, GPT-5-mini, Gemini Flash), but you can configure it to use any model supported by your providers.

**Estimates for a typical chapter (~150 sentences / 3k CJK characters / 3k words):**
| Scenario | Configuration | Models Used                                          | Est. Cost |
| :--- | :--- |:-----------------------------------------------------| :--- |
| **Balanced (Default)** | Glossary Gen + Chunking + Translation | DeepSeek V3.2 (All stages)                           | $0.05 - $0.20 |
| **Economy** | Chunking + Translation Only | GPT-5 Nano (Minimal Reasoning)                       | $0.05 - $0.10 |
| **High Quality** | Glossary Gen + Chunking + Translation | Sonnet 4 (Translation/Gen) + DeepSeek V3.2 (Utility) | $0.10 - $0.50 |
| **Premium** | All stages (incl. Post-Edit QC) | GPT-5 (High Reasoning)                               | $0.50 - $2.00+ |
| **Extreme** | Single Line + Post-Edit QC | Opus-4 (High Reasoning)                              | $10.00++ |

> [!WARNING]
> **Cost Variability**
> These are rough estimates. Actual costs can vary significantly because:
> *   **LLM Output Length**: The amount of text generated by models, and tokens used for reasoning (if the model uses it) can vary and is not strictly controllable.
> *   **Pricing Updates**: Providers may change their pricing at any time.
> *   **Chapter Length**: Web novel chapters vary greatly in length.

> [!TIP]
> **Manage Your Spending**
> If you are concerned about costs, we strongly recommend:
> 1.  **Track Usage**: Regularly check your usage on your provider's dashboard (e.g., OpenAI, OpenRouter console).
> 2.  **Set Limits**: Many providers allow you to set monthly spending limits. For example, [OpenRouter Key Settings](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys) allows setting a credit limit per API key.


## Privacy & Cost

### Why is there no free tier?
This extension is designed to be **serverless** and **privacy-focused**. We do not run a proxy server to handle your requests, which means we cannot offer a free tier subsidized by other paying users. You pay the AI providers directly for the usage, and you are fully in control of which model is being used.

### Privacy
Your API keys and translation data are stored locally in your browser and are sent directly to the AI providers you choose. No data is sent to the extension developers.
