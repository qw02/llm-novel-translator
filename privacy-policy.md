**Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy applies to the LLM Novel Translator (BYOK) chrome extension (hereby referred to as "Application").

**What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?**

The Application does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, browsing data, or user content to servers owned or operated by the developer. All configuration data, including API keys, is stored locally on your device using the browser's built-in storage mechanisms and is never transmitted to us.

**Information Transmitted to Third Parties**

The Application operates primarily as a client-side tool. We do not collect, store, or archive the content you translate (Input Data) or the resulting translations (Output Data) on servers owned or operated by the Application's developer.

However, the core functionality of the Application requires transmitting data to external parties. When you trigger a translation or analysis action:

- The Application extracts the text content from the active web page.
- This content is transmitted directly from your browser to the Application Programming Interface (API) of the third-party AI provider you have selected.
- The processed response is returned directly to your browser.

**Third-Party AI Service Providers**

The Application functions on a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) model. This means you maintain full control over which AI service provider processes your data. The Application supports connections to various providers, including but not limited to OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google Gemini, and OpenRouter.

By inputting your personal API key and selecting a provider:
- Direct Interaction: You acknowledge that you are entering into a direct interaction with that third-party provider. The Application acts solely as a technical bridge to facilitate this connection.
- Privacy Governance: The processing, storage, and retention of your data are governed entirely by the privacy policy and terms of service of the provider you have chosen.

We strongly encourage you to review the privacy policy of any provider you choose to use with the Application before transmitting sensitive content.

**Data Usage by AI Providers & Automated Training**

Because the Application utilizes your personal API credentials, the data sent to AI providers is treated according to your specific account settings with that provider.

- Model Training: Depending on the provider and your personal account configuration (e.g., specific "opt-out" settings or "zero-retention" policies), the text data transmitted by the Application may be used by the provider to train or improve their machine learning models. The Application does not control these settings; it is your responsibility to configure your API account preferences to align with your privacy requirements.
- Public Aggregated Metrics (OpenRouter): If you elect to use OpenRouter as your provider, please be aware that OpenRouter aggregates usage statistics for all traffic routed through specific applications. Consequently, aggregated metrics such as total token usage, model selection, and request frequency associated with this Application may be publicly visible on the OpenRouter platform. While this data does not typically expose the specific content of your translations, the metadata regarding your usage contributes to these public statistics.

**Security of API Keys**

Your API keys are stored locally on your device using your browser's local storage capabilities (e.g., chrome.storage.local). The Application never transmits your API keys to the developer or any third party other than the specific AI provider required to authenticate your request. You retain the ability to delete or update your keys at any time through the Application's settings interface.

**User Responsibility**

You are solely responsible for:

- Selecting an appropriate provider and understanding that provider's data handling practices
- Complying with any terms of service imposed by your chosen provider

The developer of the Application assumes no liability for how third-party providers process data transmitted through the Application at your direction.

**Changes**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to their Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-11-26

**Your Consent**

By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by the Service Provider.

**Contact Us**

If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about the practices, please contact the Service Provider via email at low.qw512@gmail.com.
